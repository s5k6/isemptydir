Test whether PATH (defaulting to `.`) is an empty directory.

    isemptydir [-n] [PATH]
    isemptydir -h

The first form returns exit code 0 iff PATH is an empty directory,
code 1 when content was found, and code 2 on error (argument is not a
directory, does not exist, is inaccessible), reporting to stderr.

With `-n`, do not follow (i.e., fail on) symbolic link.
