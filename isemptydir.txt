Synopsis

    isemptydir [-n] [PATH]     # test if PATH is an empty directory
    isemptydir -h              # print this help

In the first form, the exit code is 0 iff PATH (defaulting to the
current working directory) is verified to be an empty directory.  If
content is found, the exit code is 1.  On error, the exit code is 2.
With `-n`, do not follow symbolic links.
